# What is YASET

`yaset` is a sequence tagger written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). This tool can be used in various NLP-related sequence tagging tasks (e.g. [Named Entity Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) or [Part-of-Speech tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging)). It implements state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms for sequence tagging from the NLP community.

# Algorithms

Currently, one algorithm is implemented in hyperopt but others will follow:

* BiLSTM-Char-CRF (Lample et al., 2016)

# Installation

1. You need a working Python 3.3+ environment

2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jtourille/yaset.git
```

3. Move into the newly created directory
